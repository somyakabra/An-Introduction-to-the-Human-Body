\large{}{\underline{1) Anatomy and Physiology Defined}}
\paragraph{Two branches of science—anatomy and physiology—provide the 
foundation for understanding the body’s parts and functions. 
Anatomy (a-NAT-oˉ-mē; ana- = up; -tomy = process of cutting) is the 
science of body structures and the relationships among them.{\linewidth}
 physiology (fiz′-ē-OL-oˉ-jē; physio- = nature; -logy = study of) is the science of body functions—how the body parts work.

\large{}{\underline{2) Levels of Structural Organization and Body Systems:-}
 the body’s six levels of structural organization
 \linewidth
\newline
\begin{align}
 1)Chemical level. 
\newline
 2)Cellular level.
 \newline
3) Tissue level.
\newline
4)Organ level.
\newline
5) System level.
\newline
6)Organismal level.
\newline
\end{align}
\large{}{\underline{3) Characteristics of the Living Human Organism}}
1. Metabolism (me-TAB-oˉ-lizm) is the sum of all chemical processes 
that occur in the body. One phase of metabolism is catabolism\newline
2. Responsiveness is the body’s ability to detect and respond to 
changes.\newline3. Movement includes motion of the whole body, individual organs, single cells, and even tiny structures inside cells.\newline
Growth is an increase in body size that results from an increase 
in the size of existing cells, an increase in the number of cells, or 
both. \newline 5. Diff erentiation (dif′-er-en-shē-A--shun) is the development of a cell from an unspecialized to a specialized state.\newline
6. Reproduction (rē-proˉ-DUK-shun) refers either to (1) the formation of 
new cells for tissue growth, repair, or replacement, or (2) the production of a indivitual.\newline
\begin{align}
\large{}{\underline{4) Homeostasis}\paragraph{ Homeostas is the maintenance of relatively stable conditions in the body’s internal environment. It occurs because of the ceaseless interplay of the body’s many regulatory systems. Homeostasis is a dynamic 
condition. }\newline
\underline{Feedback Systems}  The body can regulate its internal environment through many feedback systems. A feedback system or, feedback loop, is a cycle of events in which the status of a body condition is monitored, evaluated, changed, remonitored, reevaluated, and so on.A feedback system includes three basic components: a receptor, a control center, and an effector.\end{align}\newline
\newline\large{}{\underline{5) Basic Anatomical Terminology}\paragraph
Describe the anatomical position • Relate the anatomical names and the corresponding common names for various regions of the human body.
\newline\large{}{\underline{6)Aging and Homeostasis}\paragraph{{Aging is a normal process characterized by a progressive decline in the body’s ability to restore homeostasis. 
Aging produces observable changes in structure and function and 
increases vulnerability to stress and disease.}\newline
\newline\large{}{\underline{7) Medical Imaging}\paragraph{Medical imaging refers to techniques and procedures used to create 
images of the human body. Various types of medical imaging allow 
visualization of structures inside our bodies and are increasingly 
helpful for precise diagnosis of a wide range of anatomical and physiological disorders.}
